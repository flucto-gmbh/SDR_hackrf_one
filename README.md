# SDR_hackrf_one
This repository contains a script which safes raw data collected from a hackrf_sweep as a .csv file. Further, it is possible to create a visualisation of the collected data in a heatmap. Since the SDR is only capable to collect data in a specific bandwidth at the same time, the maximum bandwith for the heatmap approx. 50 Mhz.
